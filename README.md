# WilcoxOne: Royal
A theme for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md).

This theme is available in Dark and Light modes, with a blue accent.

It's intended to be a more elegant option than the default, and works best on high density displays with good colour reproduction.

Note: this is my first shot at theming for Obsidian, so the code itself is a bit messy for my liking - but its functional.

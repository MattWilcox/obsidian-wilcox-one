# Obsidian: WilcoxOne
A theme for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md).

NOTE: This theme was for the older Obsidian, and has not been updated for the newer editor and features. It should no longer be used. One day, I may re-implement it, but as of now - it's dead.

Works best on high density displays with good colour reproduction.
Only dark mode at the moment, I may make a light mode alternate later but I don't really use text editors in light mode.
